For example, a Carry Over EOY of 5 days was applied to Year 2002 on 22 Dec 2001 for Adam Smith by an <i>e-Vacation</i> Administrator. When Adam Smith goes into <i>e-Vacation, his</i> My Leave Summary, for 2002 will show 5 days added to <i>Carry Over (from previous year)</i>.<br>

It is the responsibility of <i>e-Vacation</i> Administrators to manually adjust the values to account for any days not taken. To do so, it is recommended that the adjustments are made to the <i>Carry-over EOY</i> field.<br>
                                                                For example; Joe Bloggs had 5 days carried over into 2002, but took only 3 days vacation by 31<sup>st</sup> March. To account for the 2 days lost, change the Carry-Over EOY figure to 3 days from 5 days (i.e. Joe looses 2 days entitlement).<br></td>
