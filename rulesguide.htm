                                            A matured ELP has to be taken in a maximum of 5 years from maturation date.<br>
                                            Example:<br>
                                            ELP matures on April 14th 2008<br>
                                            Expiration date: April 14th 2013<br>

                                            <span>Booking matured ELP:</span><br>
                                            When booking / taking ELP, the full amount of days (25 days) has to be taken as one ELP leave period. The employee can also add normal vacation days to the extended leave period.<br>
                                            The employee must submit his leave request to his manager at least 3 months in advance in order to plan the leave.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            <span>Closure of ELP:</span><br>
                                            At any time an employee can choose to close his ELP account. The banked days are integrated back into the pool of the “normal” vacation to be taken by end of calendar year. Upon closure of an ELP prior to maturation, re-opening an ELP is subject to HR approval (EMEA C&amp;B manager).<br>
                                            In very specific cases (e.g. wedding – detailed list available from the ELP details on <i>Employee Services</i>), ELP can be paid out. For these specific cases, the employee can re-start an ELP at any time.<br>
                                            For both cases the employee should notify HR of this decision by letter. From this date no more days will be banked in the account.<br>
